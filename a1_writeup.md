# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
It's magic, things that would need many lines of code in other languges take words. it feels like i'm writting psuedo code for java.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I made sure to follow all the steps in wrting an effective prompt to chatGPT including designating the AIs job and it's audence. 

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
I have never worked with a file opener so when doing my number 5 with open() and read() I was working with completely new consepts unlike the other problems. 

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
in a learning enviroment the best use of AI is as a guide. having it enturpreate what you need help with and give ideas without giving the whole answer helped lead me in the right derection.
