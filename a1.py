MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I a highschooler learning to code in python. I already know how to use java and C++. 
can you give me 5 practice problems to learn the basics of python syntax and any python only methods. 

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

PROBLEM 1: [Problem Title/Description]
Problem 1: Word Frequency Counter

Topic: Dictionaries, Loops, split(), String Methods

Write a Python function that takes a string of text and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each word. 


Problem 2: List Comprehension Filter

Topic: List Comprehensions

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the squares of even numbers.



Problem 3: Unique Elements with Sets

Topic: Sets, set(), len()

Write a function that takes a list and returns True if all elements are unique, otherwise False.



Problem 4: FizzBuzz with List Comprehension

Topic: Ranges, Conditionals, List Comprehension

Write a one-liner list comprehension to generate the classic FizzBuzz from 1 to 30.

For multiples of 3, use "Fizz"

For multiples of 5, use "Buzz"

For multiples of both, use "FizzBuzz"

Otherwise, use the number itself

Python Feature: One-liner with list comprehension and ternary expressions:


Problem 5: File Word Count

Topic: File I/O, with, open(), read()

Write a Python function that takes a file name, reads the file, and returns the number of words.

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
